# Talabat SQL Data Analysis
**By Mostafa Ghorab**  

## Executive Summary
- Key Metrics: ~100K successful orders vs. ~20K failures; total GMV of $16M. New customer acquisition stands at 3,764; returning customers dominate orders and revenue.
- Revenue & Verticals: “Food” generates the highest revenue ($14.4M), followed by Grocery ($1.9M). Chennai leads city‐level revenue, far exceeding other locations.
- Cancellations & Delivery: “Online Payment” failures, customer mistakes, and vendor unavailability are top cancellation reasons. The average actual delivery time lags behind promised time, indicating potential operational inefficiencies.

## SWOT Analysis
- Strengths
  
High repeat business (returning customers) indicates strong brand loyalty.
Food vertical is a proven revenue driver, with healthy growth in grocery.
Chennai’s strong sales base offers a stable revenue foundation.

- Weaknesses
  
Significant order failures (20%) tied to payment and vendor issues.
Delays and large gaps between promised vs. actual delivery times may hurt satisfaction.
Heavy reliance on discounts ($1.75M) risks margin erosion.

- Opportunities
  
Expand grocery and other emerging verticals (pharmacy, electronics) with targeted marketing.
Improve payment reliability to reduce “Online Payment” cancellations.
Strengthen logistics to reduce late deliveries and capture more off-peak or mid-tier city demand.

- Threats
  
Competitive pressure in the food delivery/quick-commerce space.
Operational shortcomings (vendor response, courier unavailability) can degrade customer trust.
Over-dependence on a small handful of top cities and verticals.

## Business Plan Insights
- Payment Flow Improvements: Streamline online payment and fraud detection to reduce the largest single cause of order cancellations.
- Customer Retention & Upsell: Capitalize on loyal returning customers—cross-sell grocery, pharmacy, etc.
- Delivery Optimization: The gap between promised vs. actual delivery times highlights a need for better routing, courier management, and vendor readiness.
- City Focus: Chennai’s success is a model; replicate best practices in next-tier cities (e.g., Delhi, Coimbatore) to diversify revenue.

## Actionable Recommendations
- Tackle “Online Payment” Failures
  
Refine payment gateways; ensure multi-step authentication without friction.
Offer backup payment modes at checkout (e.g., wallets, UPI, COD).

- Reduce Vendor-Related Cancellations
  
Implement vendor SLA agreements, real-time vendor status tracking.
Provide vendor training on prompt order acceptance and communications.

- Close the Delivery Time Gap
  
Allocate more couriers at peak times and in high-demand zones.
Use route optimization software and real-time tracking.

- Optimize Discount Strategy
  
Target discounts to first-time or at-risk customers instead of blanket promotions.
Track promotion performance (redemption rate vs. incremental revenue) to maximize ROI.

- Diversify Revenue Streams
  
Promote grocery and pharmacy offerings through bundling or subscription models.
Identify city-level growth opportunities; intensify marketing in mid-tier cities with growing demand.
